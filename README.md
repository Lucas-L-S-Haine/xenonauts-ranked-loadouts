# Xenonauts Ranked Loadouts

This is a mod for Goldhawk Interactive's turn-based strategy game Xenonauts.
It sports a whole new list of pre-selected loadouts so you can play your
campaign more smoothly, without wasting too much time with soldier equipment.

### Motivation:

Every time I started a new campaign, I would create a new loadout for every
soldier role, and for every tech level. That would take a considerable amount of
time, and considering I was doing it once every campaign, It soon became a huge
time sink. So instead I decided to make this mod in order to begin new campaigns
already jumping into action. Altough it started for personal use, and a desire
to make an organized list of soldiers, I'm hoping this will benefit other
players.

### Features:

The list of soldier roles starts with idle soldiers. They're exactly the same
riflemen from the vanilla game with a different name and icon. I left them like
that for two reasons: to unequip soldiers more easily, and because I would
often forget to reequip my soldiers during base defense missions. At least they
are well balanced, though not very strong.

The actual list consists of riflemen, assaults, snipers, heavies, medics, light
scouts, heavy scouts, grenadiers and rocketeers. With the exception of
rocketeers, they all are ranked according to tech level, meaning weapons and
armor. The tech levels are listed below:

```
rookie: ballistic weapons
junior: laser weapons and jackal armor
senior: plasma weapons and wolf/buzzard armor
expert: MAG weapons and sentinel/predator armor
```

To end the list there are rocketeers. They are not ranked because I can just
change their armors individually, while there isn't a need to upgrade their
weapons. They also don't carry pistols anymore to make room for a few more
rockets, and because I can always pick an alien weapon from the ground.
